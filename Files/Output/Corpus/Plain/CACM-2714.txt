merging with parallel processors consider two linearly ordered sets a b am bn mn and p pm parallel processors working synchronously the paper presents an algorithm for merging a and b with the p parallel processors which requires at most 2[log2 2m+1)]+[3 3mp mplog2 nm steps if n 2 2bm b an integer the algorithm requires at most 2[log2 m 1 mp2 b steps in the case where m and n are of the same order of magnitude i e nkm with k being a constant the algorithm requires 2[log2 m 1 mp3 k steps these performances compare very favorably with the previous best parallel merging algorithm batcher s algorithm which requires np m n2plog2 m steps in the general case and kmp k 12mplog2 m in the special case where nkm cacm october 1975 gavril f parallel processing parallel merging parallel binary insertion 5.31 ca751005 jb january 6 1978 10:50 am
